Welcome to "Building JavaScript Apps with ChatGPT Snippets", the ultimate guide to building powerful and efficient JavaScript apps using the latest ChatGPT technology.

JavaScript is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, and it powers many of the web's most popular apps and sites. However, building JavaScript apps can be a time-consuming and challenging process, especially for developers who are just starting out.

That's where ChatGPT comes in. ChatGPT is a powerful tool that uses artificial intelligence to generate code snippets based on natural language input. By using ChatGPT, developers can speed up their development process and create high-quality code with ease.

 In this book, we'll walk you through the process of building a real-life application called Guda that has a front-end in ReactJS and a back-end on WAX blockchain using waxjs.

With step-by-step instructions, helpful code examples, and real-world applications, you'll learn how to set up a new project, create a skeleton, and integrate ChatGPT code snippets seamlessly into your app. We'll cover best practices for using ChatGPT, tips for getting the most out of it, and common pitfalls to avoid. You'll also learn how to build more advanced features, such as artificial intelligence integration, and how to incorporate third-party libraries and APIs.

Throughout the book, we'll use the Guda application as a real-world example, teaching you how to create a geolocation-aware app that displays YouTube videos tagged with ISO3 country codes and a map made with LeafletJS. By the end of this book, you'll have a solid foundation for building your own powerful and efficient JavaScript apps using ChatGPT.

## How this book was written

This book is a combination of ChatGPT and hand written by the author Gudasol. I get most of the answers from ChatGPT, then edit them for better content. I also write some chapters completely. I want to be transparent about this process, and invite you to [contact me](https://github.com/dougbutner) if you see something off.

# Setting up the project

- Choosing an appropriate development environment
- Installing any necessary dependencies
- Creating a basic file structure for the app

Setting up your development environment is a crucial first step in building a React app with ChatGPT. In this chapter, we'll walk you through the process of choosing the right development environment, installing any necessary dependencies, and creating a basic file structure for your app.

### Choosing an appropriate development environment

For building the Guda app, we recommend using a text editor like VS Code or Atom along with the Create React App tool. Create React App is a popular, opinionated tool for setting up a new React project that comes with a pre-configured development environment.

### Installing any necessary dependencies

To get started with the Guda app, you'll need to install some necessary dependencies. These include:

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript outside of a web browser.
- npm or Yarn: Package managers that allow you to manage and install third-party packages and libraries for your app.
- Create React App: A tool for setting up a new React project that comes pre-configured with a development environment.

To install these dependencies, you'll need to follow the specific instructions for each one. For example, to install Node.js and npm, you can visit the Node.js website and download the installer for your operating system. Once you've installed Node.js and npm, you can use the npm command to install Create React App:

```
npm install -g create-react-app
```

### Creating a basic file structure for the app

Once you've installed any necessary dependencies, it's time to create a basic file structure for your app. Create React App comes with a pre-configured file structure that includes several key files and directories

- public/index.html: The main HTML file for your app.
- src/index.js: The main JavaScript file for your app.
- src/App.js: The main component for your app.
- src/App.css: The main CSS file for your app.
- src/components: A directory where you can store additional components for your app.
- src/assets: A directory where you can store images, fonts, and other static files.

Here's an example of what your file structure might look like:

```

guda/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    index.js
    components/
      Map.js
      VideoList.js
    assets/
      logo.png
      font.ttf

```

Of course, the specific structure of your app will depend on its needs. You may need additional directories for other files or libraries, or you may need to organize your files in a different way. The important thing is to create a structure that makes sense for your specific app.

### Chapter Conclusion

Setting up your development environment and creating a basic file structure for your app is a critical first step in building a React app with ChatGPT. By choosing the right development environment, installing any necessary dependencies, and creating a clear and organized file structure, you'll be well on your way to building a high-quality app that leverages the power of ChatGPT.

# Creating a skeleton

- Setting up the basic HTML and CSS structure
- Creating any necessary JavaScript files
- Configuring any necessary build tools or task runners

In this chapter, we'll show you how to create a skeleton that you can use as the foundation for your ChatGPT-powered JavaScript app. We'll use a sample app called Guda as an example, which will have a front end built with ReactJS and a back end running on the WAX blockchain using the waxjs library. The app will display YouTube videos tagged with ISO3 country codes, and will also feature a map built with LeafletJS.

### Setting up the basic HTML and CSS structure

The first step in creating your app is to set up the basic HTML and CSS structure. For our Guda app, we'll create an HTML file with a basic structure that includes the necessary CSS and JavaScript files. We'll also create a CSS file that will define the styles for the app.

Here's an example of what the HTML file might look like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Guda</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

And here's an example of what the CSS file might look like:
```

```
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

#root {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```

Creating any necessary JavaScript files

Next, we'll create any necessary JavaScript files. For our Guda app, we'll need a main app file (app.js), a file to handle the YouTube API (youtube.js), and a file to handle the Leaflet map (map.js).

Here's an example of what the app.js file might look like:

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './components/App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

And here's an example of what the youtube.js file might look like:

```
jsCopy code
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY_HERE';

export const getVideosForCountry = async (iso3) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search?part=snippet&maxResults=10&q=${iso3}&type=video&key=${API_KEY}`);
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.items;
};
```

Finally, here's an example of what the map.js file might look like:

```
import L from 'leaflet';

export const createMap = (containerId) => {
  const map = L.map(containerId).setView([0, 0], 2);
  L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
    attribution: 'Map data &copy; OpenStreetMap contributors',
    maxZoom: 18,
  }).addTo(map);
  return map;
};

```

Configuring any necessary build tools or task runners

Finally, we'll need to configure any necessary build tools or task runners. For our Guda app, we'll use Create React App to build our front-end, and we'll use the WAXjs library to interact with the WAX blockchain.

To set up Create React App, you can follow the instructions on the Create React App website. To set up the WAXjs library, you can install it using npm:

```
npm install waxjs
```

# Getting here through prompting

To get started with creating the Guda app, you can follow the prompts below. ChatGPT will give you code to put into terminal if you need some extra help.

1. Create a new directory for your app and navigate to it in the terminal.

```
mkdir guda-app
cd guda-app
```

1. Initialize a new React app using Create React App.

```
npx create-react-app client
cd client
```

1. Install the dependencies you will need for the app.

```
npm install axios leaflet react-leaflet waxjs
```

1. Create a new file called **`index.html`** in the **`public`** directory of your React app.

```
cd public
touch index.html
```

1. Copy and paste the following code into your **`index.html`** file:
